Factor(up_probability=0.2, 
reason=The current stock price of Sezzle Inc. (SEZL) is at 7.308, which is below the high-volume zone defined by the price bin (8.173, 8.673] where the majority of volume (2,816,400 shares) has traded. This indicates that many traders are currently at a loss, creating substantial overhead resistance. Additionally, the absence of volume in the price range immediately above the current price suggests that there are few buyers willing to step in, decreasing the likelihood of a price rise. Overall, the scenario favors resistance over support, leading to a low probability of upward movement.)
