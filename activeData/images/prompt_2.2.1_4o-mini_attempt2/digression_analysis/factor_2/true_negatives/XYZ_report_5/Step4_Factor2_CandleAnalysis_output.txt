reason=The recent price action shows Block Inc. is in a down trend, with short-term moving averages (20-day) below longer-term moving averages (60-day), indicating weakening momentum. The candlestick chart shows high volatility with several sizable price drops and significant volume spikes, suggesting market uncertainty. Recent volume trends indicate fluctuating participation, but include days of notably high volume during declines, which may imply selling pressure. No clear bullish candlestick patterns are present, tilting the probability towards a potential downward move following earnings. Thus, the probability of a price increase post-earnings is estimated at 40%.)
