Factor(up_probability=0.4, 
reason=The stock is currently in a downtrend with the short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) below the long-term averages (60-day, 120-day), indicating sustained weakness. Recent candlestick behavior shows increased volatility with mixed signals. Additionally, volume is elevated but follows a pattern of higher trading on days of downtrending prices, suggesting a selling sentiment rather than accumulation. Despite some bullish candlestick patterns forming, the overall trend analysis does not support a high probability of price increases following the upcoming earnings report.)
