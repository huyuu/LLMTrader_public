reason=QuidelOrtho Corporation (QDEL) has displayed a mixed short-term trend. The recent price has formed a downtrend evidenced by a decline to a closing price of 69.54 on February 12, after reaching a higher peak recently. The moving averages suggest a bearish setup with the 20-day moving average below the 60-day average. However, the trading volume has seen spikes, especially on February 5, with over 510,000 shares traded, indicating some strong interest amidst the downtrend. The candle patterns present a mix of higher volatility with signs of indecision. Therefore, while the downward trend limits the probability of an immediate rise post-earnings, the significant volume and volatility suggest some potential for a rebound, leading to an estimated 60% likelihood of price increase after the earnings announcement.)
