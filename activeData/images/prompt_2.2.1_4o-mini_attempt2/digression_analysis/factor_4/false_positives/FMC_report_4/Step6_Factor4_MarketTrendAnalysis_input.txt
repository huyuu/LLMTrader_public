<Task Instructions>
You are a financial expert responsible for evaluating how the broader market trend, particularly the trend of the industry in which the company operates, will influence the likelihood that the company’s stock price will rise following the upcoming earnings report. Your task is to analyze both the price trend and volume trend of the relevant market and estimate the probability that the stock will go up post-earnings.
</Task Instructions>

<Analysis Methodology>
Use the data given in <context> and the following two key indicators to assess how the company’s stock may be influenced by broader market dynamics:

1. Stock Market Trend Alignment
   - Determine whether the company’s industry is aligned with the current mainstream market trend given by <market trends>.
   - Mainstream trends refer to sectors or themes that have recently shown strong price momentum, institutional fund inflows, or high investor attention (e.g., AI, aerospace, clean energy).
   - Companies in trend-aligned sectors may see strong upward reactions even on moderate fundamental improvements due to heightened market enthusiasm.
   - Companies in sectors out of favor may experience muted reactions even on strong earnings.

2. Volume Trend of the Stock or Sector
   - Analyze the average daily trading volume of the stock over the past 1 to 3 months.
   - A rising volume trend indicates increasing investor interest and market participation, supporting a higher probability of positive price movement.
   - A declining volume trend may signal fading attention and weaker potential for a strong post-earnings reaction.

Use these two indicators to assess whether the stock is likely to benefit from market momentum or face headwinds, and estimate the likelihood of a post-earnings price increase accordingly.
Probability 0.5 means either you can't judge from the given <context>, or all the above signals are fully contradictory.
Probability 1.0 means all the above signals show strong positive sign.
Probability 0.0 means all the above signals show strong negative sign.
</Analysis Methodology>

<Output Instruction>
Output the result in the following format:
Factor(up_probability = ..., reason = "...")

Where:
- up_probability is a float between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. 0.75 means 75% chance of rising)
- reason should explain how market trend and volume dynamics affect your probability estimate
</Output Instruction>

<Remarks>
- Use only data provided in <context>
- Do not make assumptions about the earnings results—focus solely on market and sector dynamics
- Do not default to up_probability = 0.5 unless all indicators are neutral or contradictory
- Be specific about whether the company is part of a strong market trend and if trading volume supports upside potential
</Remarks>

The company name is FMC Corporation Common Stock.
The company's symbol is FMC

The company's overview is
FMC Corporation is a prominent player in the agricultural sector, specifically focusing on crop protection products and services. Recent strategic shifts include the sale of its Global Specialty Solutions business to Envu, which allows FMC to concentrate more intensively on its core agricultural offerings. This decision is designed to enhance market effectiveness and potentially improve stock value. In Q3 2024, FMC reported a 9% revenue increase, reflective of robust sales in North and Latin America, although it continues to face pricing pressures in a competitive landscape marked by innovation demands. Major competitors in this space remain, and the sale to Envu may enhance FMC's product offerings, particularly for greenhouse growers. However, the recent disbanding of its venture capital arm, FMC Ventures, signals both operational changes and potential investor concerns regarding innovation pace in the agtech domain. Despite these challenges, the company's overall growth trajectory appears strong, positioning it favorably within the agricultural market while also indicating resilience against pressures affecting the industry.
