reason=FMC Corporation reported a strong 9% revenue increase in Q3 2024, surpassing market expectations, which supports the likelihood of a bullish market reaction. The recent strategic sale allows FMC to refocus on its core offerings, potentially stabilizing its market position. However, EPS numbers show a stark decline from $0.52 to -$0.13, which may raise investor concerns. While this signals a profit drop in the recent quarter, the company's strong revenue performance and operational changes point towards resilience. Additionally, the decreasing trends in both the PE and PS ratios suggest that the stock is becoming more reasonably valued, potentially attracting buyers. The overall positive growth trajectory relative to market expectations strengthens the upside probability, though caution remains due to the downturn in EPS. Overall, I estimate a 70% chance that the stock price will rise after the earnings report.)
