Factor(up_probability=0.3, 
reason=The recent financial performance of Intel Corporation reveals several concerning indicators. Firstly, both total revenue and EBITDA have shown a downward trend in Q2 2024 compared to Q1 2024, indicating potential operational challenges. Additionally, the diluted EPS also decreased from -0.09 in Q1 to -0.38 in Q2, missing expectations severely which raises concerns about financial health and market perceptions. The significant negative net income for the two quarters reflects ongoing issues and increases the likelihood of a bearish response post-earnings. Furthermore, while there has been a strategic joint venture and product announcements that could position Intel for growth in the AI sector, the immediate financial indicators are strong negatives. Lastly, both PE and PS ratios have been decreasing which suggests potential overvaluation concerns. Given these factors, the overall up probability after the next earnings report is estimated at 30%.)
