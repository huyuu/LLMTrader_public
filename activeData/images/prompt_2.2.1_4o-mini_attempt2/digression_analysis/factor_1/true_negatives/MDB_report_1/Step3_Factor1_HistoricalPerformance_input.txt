<Task Instructions>
You are a financial expert responsible for evaluating how a company's recent financial performance will affect the likelihood that its stock price will rise following the upcoming earnings report. Your task is to assess the financial indicators from the most recent two quarters and estimate the probability that the stock will go up in the short term after the release of its new earnings report. Please base your prediction solely on the information provided under the <context> tag.
</Task Instructions>

<Analysis Methodology>
Analyze the following elements from the company’s most recent two quarters given in <historical performance metrics>:
1. Revenue / EPS / EBITDA performance vs. market expectations
   - If these indicators consistently exceed analysts' expectations, the stock price is more likely to rise.
   - If they fall short of expectations, the stock price is more likely to decline.

2. Growth trend and acceleration
   - If these indicators show positive growth, this indicates strong company performance, and the stock price may rise. 
   - Conversely, negative growth suggests weak performance, potentially leading to a drop in stock price.

3. Valuation trend (<PE Ratio Transition>, <PS Ratio Transition>)
   - Evaluate whether the company's valuation is reasonable by examining its Price-to-Earnings ratio transition given by <PE Ratio Transition>, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio transition given by <PS Ratio Transition> over the past six months. A higher-than-average <PE Ratio Transition> or <PS Ratio Transition> may suggest overvaluation. 
   - However, if these ratios have been steadily increasing—indicating that the current price is much higher than the historical average—it could still be justified if the industry or the stock itself is experiencing major positive shifts or tailwinds.

4. Guidance strength expectation
   - If the company is likely to guide above consensus expectations (based on recent performance and sector signals), the probability of a price increase improves.
   - If guidance may fall short, downside risks increase.

Use these signals to infer how the market is likely to react to the next earnings event. Predict the probability that the stock price will go up immediately after the report.
Probability 0.5 means either you can't judge from the given <context>, or all the above signals are fully contradictory.
Probability 1.0 means all the above signals show strong positive sign.
Probability 0.0 means all the above signals show strong negative sign.
</Analysis Methodology>

<Output Instruction>
Output the result in the following format:
Factor(up_probability = ..., reason = "...")

Where:
- up_probability is a float between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. 0.75 means 75% chance of rising)
- reason should clearly explain the logic and evidence leading to your prediction
</Output Instruction>

<Remarks>
- Use only the data provided in <context>.
- Do not speculate about actual earnings results.
- Your role is to anticipate how investors will react based on expectations.
- If signals conflict, make a balanced judgment based on strength and reliability.
- If all signals are inconclusive, set up_probability to 0.5
- Use the relative strength of bullish vs. bearish signals to determine your probability value.
- Clearly explain which signals you weighted most and why.
</Remarks>
