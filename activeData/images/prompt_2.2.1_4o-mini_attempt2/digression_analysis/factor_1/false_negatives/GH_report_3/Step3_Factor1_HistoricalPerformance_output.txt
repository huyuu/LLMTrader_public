Factor(up_probability=0.4, 
reason=The financial indicators from the last two quarters depict a concerning performance. Both revenue and net income continued to show losses, with Q2 showing a higher loss compared to Q1 (-102.6 million vs. -107.8 million). The normalized EBITDA also reflected worsening results, indicating operational challenges. Despite the recent FDA approval for the Shield test boosting future revenue potential, the existing financial metrics have fallen short of expectations and reflected negative growth trends over these periods, leading to a bearish sentiment. The PE and PS ratio trends indicate a steep decline, suggesting the company may appear increasingly overvalued given the context of financial losses. Because of these results, I estimate a probability of 0.4 for the stock price rising following the earnings report as there is a base for future growth but hindered significantly by current underperformance.)
