You are a financial expert tasked with analyzing the impact of a company's historical performance metrics on its stock price change (in percentage). These metrics include Revenue, Earnings Per Share (EPS), and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), among others. Based on the factors and following guidance ,analyzing the financial reports from the most recently published two quarters and predict the price change (in percentage) after the release of the upcoming financial report. Additionally, an important factor influencing the stock price post-earnings report is the company's guidance among the earnings release.
How this factor influences the stock price:
1.Consistently Exceeding Expectations: If these indicators consistently exceed analysts' expectations, the stock price is more likely to rise. If they fall short of expectations, the stock price is more likely to decline.
2.Growth Trends: If these indicators show positive growth, this indicates strong company performance, and the stock price may rise. Conversely, negative growth suggests weak performance, potentially leading to a drop in stock price.
3.Rate of Change : Accelerated growth in these indicators may amplify stock price increases.Faster declines may intensify stock price drops.
4.Valuation Reasonableness: Evaluate whether the company's valuation is reasonable by examining its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio over the past six months. A higher-than-average P/E or P/S may suggest overvaluation. However, if these ratios have been steadily increasing—indicating that the current price is much higher than the historical average—it could still be justified if the industry or the stock itself is experiencing major positive shifts or tailwinds.
5.Guidance Above Expectations: If the guidance for the upcoming earnings report exceeds analysts' expectations, the stock price is likely to rise post-earnings release. Therefore, assess whether the upcoming earnings guidance can exceed analysts' expectations based on the financial performance of the last two quarters and recent industry news to predict the stock price post-earnings report.Additionally, search the internet for news from the past two months to evaluate whether the news is positive or negative, and use this to further assess the likelihood of exceeding guidance expectations. For example:Positive News: If the news indicates industry trends such as supply shortages or surging demand, the likelihood of the company raising its guidance and exceeding analysts' expectations increases.Negative News: Conversely, if the news reports industry oversupply, price wars, new competitors entering the market, or shortages in upstream raw materials, the likelihood of the company's guidance falling short of analysts' expectations increases.By combining the analysis of financial data and industry news, please assess whether the company's guidance to be announced during the upcoming earnings call will exceed analysts' expectations.

The company name is Lyft Inc. Class A Common Stock.
The company's symbol is LYFT.
The company's overview is
Lyft Inc. operates primarily in the ride-sharing industry, directly competing with other mobility providers like Uber in the United States. Recently, Lyft faced significant regulatory scrutiny, agreeing to a $2.1 million settlement due to misleading advertisements regarding driver earnings, which could tarnish its public image and affect operational practices. In contrast, Lyft has partnered with DoorDash, AXS, and integrated Cash App Pay to enhance customer experience, potentially increasing user engagement. Despite promising partnerships, regulatory challenges and negative news weigh heavily on Lyft's image. Its market position is under pressure from intense competition and compliance issues, making its future outlook cautiously optimistic at best..
