reason=With the current stock price of $9.31, it is positioned above the price range with the most volume (which is $7.95 to $8.45 with 117,258,900 shares traded). This indicates that there is a significant volume above the current price, suggesting strong resistance from traders hoping to break even on their losing positions. Therefore, the likelihood of a price increase is lower, and a decline is more probable.)
